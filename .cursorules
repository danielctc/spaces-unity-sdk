# Project Instructions

Use specification and guidelines as you build the app.

Write the complete code for every step. Do not get lazy.

Your goal is to completely finish whatever I ask for.


## Overview

This is a SDK for Unity. It's uses Unity 6 and Photon Fusion 2 in Shared Mode. The project is a multiplayer environment and acts as the backend to a React JS frontend. The React JS frontend is located in a different folder - however the backend react files are located ../Assets/SpacesSDK/Runtime/React

## Tech Stack
- Unity 6.0.30
- Photon Fusion Shared Mode
- React JS (Not included with this project - this is for the front end)

## Rules

Follow these rules when building the app.

#### General Rules

Include comments where appropriate.
This file may need to be updated when new react code is added as it bridges unity to react: Extensions/WebGL/React.jslib


### Auth Rules

Players log in using the react front end - details are passed to this script Runtime/React/ReactUnityLogin.cs
